# Sorting Sidebar Content

To sort a file/directory in the sidebar as you needed, you can add the `weight` frontmatter properties on top of the page.

```md
---
weight: 3
--

# Page Content
```

The minimum value is `1`. And the smaller the value is, the page/directory will be placed on top of the sidebar.
