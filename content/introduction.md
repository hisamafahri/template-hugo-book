# Introduction

This is my personal template for [Hugo Books](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book). This documentation were meant to be versatile and ready-to-use template that I (or anyone) can use to create the documentation site that they needed.

## Structure

I am a [big fan](https://hisam.dev/journals/2024-06-17/#the-challenges) of the [Diátaxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/). Hence, if possible I (and I also recommend you) to structure it that way.

If you're curious to learn more about the structure, you can read the quick guides [here](https://diataxis.fr/start-here/).

## Getting Started

- Clone this repository: https://github.com/hisamafahri/template-hugo-book
    * This is also a template repository, so you can easily use the [`Use this template`](https://github.com/new?template_name=template-hugo-book&template_owner=hisamafahri) button on GitHub
- Configure the site in the [`hugo.toml` file](https://github.com/hisamafahri/template-hugo-book/edit/main/hugo.toml)
    * I've configured this site to be as complete-as possible.
    * But, if you want more control, use [this](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book/blob/main/exampleSite/hugo.toml) as the complete example
- Write and deploy!
